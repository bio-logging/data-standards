We aim to bring together people and data to allow large scale analyses and collaborations with conservation outcomes.","Australia's Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) Ocean Data Network includes data collections for Acoustic Telemetry, which uses a continental-scale array of strategically placed underwater acoustic receivers and a central data repository to monitor and track broad-scale movements of tagged animals, and Animal Tagging, which deploys satellite-relayed transmitters equipped with miniaturised oceanographic sensors on marine species (i.e. seals, and sea turtles ) to collect behavioural (movements, dive behaviour) and physical (depth, temperature and salinity) data.","Using a fund from \"Application of big data of marine life (program manager Tom Akamatsu)\" by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan, we have established a new biologging data base \"Biologging intelligent Platform\". BiP can accept various parameters not only horizontal position, but also behavioral data such as diving depth, flight altitude, speed, and acceleration, as well as physiological data such as body temperature, along with related metadata. BiP standardizes the information to facilitate secondary data analysis. A unique feature of BiP is the Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) tools that calculate environmental parameters, such as surface currents, ocean winds, and waves from data collected by animals. To enhance data accessibility, BiP allows users to search for datasets using the DOI of the paper in which the data was used.","Comprehensive digitalization of the animal and environment becomes more and more important for scientific society and sustainable development of the world. Establishment of an ubiquitous network for transmitting the multidimensional data of animals, such as location, surrounding environment, behaviour, audio, and video etc., can facilitate the efficiency of data acquisition. Despite existing cellular networks and developing satellite networks, a natural network is the people's engagement with their smartphones. Please visit www.druid.tech and www.intelinkgo.com for more information.","In 2020, the International Bio-Logging Society, together with several partner organizations, launched the COVID-19 Bio-Logging Initiative, to investigate how wildlife responded to altered levels of human mobility during the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal of the Initiative is to use bio-logging data collected before, during, and after lockdowns to advance our understanding of human–wildlife interactions and inform global conservation efforts.","EuroMammals is a 15 yrs old bottom-up collaborative project on spatial ecology of European terrestrial mammals. See euromammals.org","The European Tracking Network is a pan-European network uniting researchers working (primarily) on acoustic telemetry, providing, e.g., a centralized database and working towards compatibility of research equipment and establishing data flows of open-access aquatic tracking data into Digital Twin of the Ocean initiatives.","GBIF is an international network and data infrastructure funded by the world's governments and aimed at providing free and open access to biodiversity data. GBIF accepts biologging data published in the Darwin Core standard, allowing it to be more widely discovered and used in combination with other species occurrence data.","Global Wader is a community-led initiative aiming to provide a definitive register of all wader/shorebird tracking projects currently underway or completed. The project has three main purposes: (1) maintain an up-to-date register of all wader tracking projects currently undertaken; (2) encourage best practices in the long-term storage of tracking data, including the use of specialist repositories via a partnership with Movebank; (3) facilitate collaborations between trackers, scientists and conservationists, including promoting open access to data, and facilitating data-sharing where appropriate, particularly for efforts towards the conservation of these species.","This group is aims to (1) oversee Task Groups that document common approaches for data exchange formats for machine observations; (2) provide a point of contact and facilitate discussion on modelling machine observation scenarios, including bio-logging, and (3) serve as point of contact and facilitate discussion on publishing machine observations in biodiversity infrastructures like GBIF and OBIS. Currently machine observation data tend to be housed outside these infrastructures, leaving them undiscoverable and left out of the larger biodiversity record.","The Motus Wildlife Tracking System (Motus) is an international collaborative research network that uses coordinated automated radio telemetry to facilitate research and education on the ecology and conservation of migratory animals. Motus is a program of Birds Canada in partnership with collaborating researchers and organizations.","Movebank is an online platform helping thousands of researchers and wildlife managers worldwide to manage, share, analyze and archive animal tracking and other animal-borne sensor data. The platform includes a suite of tools and services leveraging a shared database. Data owners harmonize incoming data from live feeds and archived files, add contextual metadata, and  and to support public exploration and automation of downstream processes that access data. Owners choose whether and with whom to share their data: Movebank offers a formal archiving service that issues DOIs and also supports secure sharing of restricted data.","The attributes used in Movebank are available as a persistent, machine-readable vocabulary, hosted on the British Oceanographic Data Centre‚Äôs Natural Environment Research Council NERC Vocabulary Server at vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/MVB. The vocabulary has been built over time with input from hundreds of researchers and tag manufacturers, is used by initiatives, software packages and tag providers to offer consistent, transparent data reading, processing and storage.","Movepub is an R package to prepare animal tracking data from Movebank for publication in a research repository. With movepub you can document data with metadata following the Data Package standard and transform these to Darwin Core and Ecological Metadata Language (EML) for publication to the GBIF and OBIS. The approach was developed in the MOVE2GBIF project and described in van der Kolk et al. (2022, https://doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.1123.90623).",null,"OBIS is an international network and data infrastructure to provide access to the world’s ocean biodiversity and biogeographic data. It is a project under the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO. OBIS accepts biologging data published in the Darwin Core standard, allowing it to be more widely discovered and used in combination with other species occurrence data.","The Ocean Tracking Network (OTN) is a global aquatic research, data management and partnership platform headquartered at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. OTN's mission is to inform the stewardship and sustainable management of aquatic animals by providing knowledge on their movements, habitats and survival in the face of changing global environments.","We have described a minimum reporting standard for instrument characteristics to facilitate future meta-analyses on the impacts of biologging instruments on animal welfare and data quality.","The BirdLife International Seabird Tracking Database is a central store for seabird tracking data from around the world and aims to help further seabird conservation work and support the tracking community.","SEATRACK aims to map the non-breeding distribution of seabirds breeding in colonies encircling the North Atlantic. We mainly use geolocators and have developed a standardised data procedure and a centralised database to ensure data integrity and traceability. Further, the project builds on an agreement of understanding between all partners as well as a science plan and a data request form.","The Shorebird Science and Conservation Collective brings together the knowledge of agencies, universities, nonprofits, and community scientists to advance shorebird conservation in the Western Hemisphere through the sharing of shorebird tracking data. To-date, over 7 million locations from >3,000 individual tracked shorebirds of 36 species have been shared by over 88 organizations, cleaned, and integrated into a central resource to inform on-the-ground conservation projects. A detailed description of the Shorebird Collective and its work in the first three years can be found at: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.01.30.576574v3","Operating under the NOAA Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS), the multi-agency U.S. Animal Telemetry Network was developed in 2016 to provide unity, stability and continuity to the national infrastructure that facilitates the collection, management, standarization and availability of marine animal telemetry data derived through satellite, archival and acoustic tags and seeks to promote the integration of these data into our nation's ocean observing system cabapilities.","Researchers are monitoring more animals for longer and collecting a range of multi-media information about individuals throughout their lives. In addition to the sensor recordings themselves, information can come from photographs, text messages and news articles. Further, as more projects are shared and archived, we see a need to be able to recognize individuals across datasets to enable future efforts to bring together data globally. To address these challenges, we have launched the Movebank Life History Museum (MoMu) and Unique Animal Identifier (UAID) system to store accessory files related to tracked wildlife and assign persistent and unique identifiers for animals. We invite all to participate in beta testing of these new tools.","SLU Wireless Remote Animal Monitoring (WRAM) is a national e-infrastructure for biologging and tracking, designed to support project management, data collection, storage, and visualization. Initiated in the early 2000s, WRAM currently holds data on nearly 6,000 individuals across 24 different species. It is also a core component of the Swedish Biodiversity Data Infrastructure (SBDI)—Sweden’s GBIF node and the largest biodiversity database in the country, aggregating data from a wide range of sources. WRAM is designed to accommodate both spatial and non-spatial data, supporting a broad range of research and monitoring efforts. Ongoing developments focus on improving the database’s performance and interoperability, including the implementation of the within SBDI-developed biologging sensor data model (https://github.com/biodiversitydata-se/biologging-sensor-datamodel). This integration aims to enhance the handling of metadata and promote standardized, efficient data management across platforms."],["<a href=\"https://euromammals.org/afrimove/\">https://euromammals.org/afrimove/<\/a>","<a href=\"https://imos.org.au/facility/animal-tracking\">https://imos.org.au/facility/animal-tracking<\/a>","<a href=\"https://www.bip-earth.com/\">https://www.bip-earth.com/<\/a>","<a href=\"https://www.druid.tech\">https://www.druid.tech<\/a>","<a href=\"https://bio-logging.net/wg/covid19-biologging\">https://bio-logging.net/wg/covid19-biologging<\/a>","<a href=\"https://www.euromammals.org\">https://www.euromammals.org<\/a>","<a href=\"https://europeantrackingnetwork.org\">https://europeantrackingnetwork.org<\/a>","<a href=\"https://www.gbif.org\">https://www.gbif.org<\/a>","<a href=\"https://www.globalwader.org\">https://www.globalwader.org<\/a>","<a href=\"https://www.tdwg.org/community/mobs\">https://www.tdwg.org/community/mobs<\/a>","<a href=\"https://motus.org\">https://motus.org<\/a>","<a href=\"https://www.movebank.org\">https://www.movebank.org<\/a>","<a href=\"https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/MVB\">https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/MVB<\/a>","<a href=\"https://github.com/inbo/movepub\">https://github.com/inbo/movepub<\/a>","<a href=\"https://seamap.env.duke.edu\">https://seamap.env.duke.edu<\/a>","<a href=\"https://obis.org\">https://obis.org<\/a>","<a href=\"https://oceantrackingnetwork.org\">https://oceantrackingnetwork.org<\/a>","<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.32942/X29K7X\">https://doi.org/10.32942/X29K7X<\/a>","<a href=\"https://data.seabirdtracking.org\">https://data.seabirdtracking.org<\/a>",null,null,"<a href=\"https://atn.ioos.us\">https://atn.ioos.us<\/a>","<a href=\"https://animaltracker.app\">https://animaltracker.app<\/a>","<a href=\"https://wram.slu.se\">https://wram.slu.se<\/a>"],["collaborative initiative","data platform","data platform",null,"collaborative initiative","data platform","data platform","data platform","collaborative initiative","data standards","data platform","data platform","data vocabulary","analysis tool","data platform","data platform","data platform","reporting standard","data platform","collaborative initiative","collaborative initiative","data platform","data platform","data platform"]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Project<\/th>\n      <th>Lead organization<\/th>\n      <th>Contact Name<\/th>\n      <th>Contact Email<\/th>\n      <th>Description<\/th>\n      <th>Website<\/th>\n      <th>Tags<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"pageLength":20,"columnDefs":[{"name":"Project","targets":0},{"name":"Lead organization","targets":1},{"name":"Contact Name","targets":2},{"name":"Contact Email","targets":3},{"name":"Description","targets":4},{"name":"Website","targets":5},{"name":"Tags","targets":6}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false,"lengthMenu":[10,20,25,50,100]}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
