Biologging intelligent Platform,University of Tokyo,Katsufumi Sato,katsu at aori.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Using a fund from ""Application of big data of marine life (program manager Tom Akamatsu)"" by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan, we have established a new biologging data base ""Biologging intelligent Platform"". BiP can accept various parameters not only horizontal position, but also behavioral data such as diving depth, flight altitude, speed, and acceleration, as well as physiological data such as body temperature, along with related metadata. BiP standardizes the information to facilitate secondary data analysis. A unique feature of BiP is the Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) tools that calculate environmental parameters, such as surface currents, ocean winds, and waves from data collected by animals. To enhance data accessibility, BiP allows users to search for datasets using the DOI of the paper in which the data was used.",www.bip-earth.com/,data platform

Unique Animal IDs,Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior,Martin Wiskelski,,"Researchers are monitoring more animals for longer and collecting a range of multi-media information about individuals throughout their lives. In addition to the sensor recordings themselves, information can come from photographs, text messages and news articles. Further, as more projects are shared and archived, we see a need to be able to recognize individuals across datasets to enable future efforts to bring together data globally. To address these challenges, we have launched the Movebank Life History Museum (MoMu) and Unique Animal Identifier (UAID) system to store accessory files related to tracked wildlife and assign persistent and unique identifiers for animals. We invite all to participate in beta testing of these new tools.",https://animaltracker.app,data platform
